# Custom Agent
This release covers Task 01: Custom agent and tool `docs/tasks/0301_custom_agent.md`
it is a continuaiton from earlier release `0.1.0` `dev/010_custom_agent.md`

## Situation
Part 1 of the assignment is to build a custom Roaming Plan Recommendation Agent.
In the earlier release `0.1.0`, the Agent was partially implemented with

- **Recommendation tool** - full functionality using an SQLite database backend
- **AI User Intent Classifer** - one-shot Agent using OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo to classify the User prompt as either on or off topic

In this release, both of these two tools are plugged in to a LangChain AI Agent to manage the full end-to-end workflow.

## Session logs

session logs are timestamped to Singapore timezone in reverse chronological order, with latest entries at the top, and earlier entries at the bottom.
