# Guidelines

## Submission Deadline
Please submit your completed assignment by **14th July 2025**. We will take stock of your submitted repository for evaluation at this point. After that, any further commits will not be part of the evaluation but can be considered as interview preparations.

## Reference Repository
Your tasks will be based on the following OpenAI CS Agents Demo repository: [OpenAI CS Agents Demo](https://github.com/openai/openai-cs-agents-demo)

Please fork this repository and use it as the foundation for completing the tasks. Feel free to swap framework or model providers as you see fit. (Ps: Our team uses Langchain/Langgraph and will be happy to review code written in these frameworks)

## Expected Deliverable Artifacts
Submit the following:

- Link to your GitHub fork. Do ensure that the repository is accessible! The repo should contain the following
- Artifacts for your completed tasks (code and documentation)
- Instructions to run your code â€“ you are recommended to make the application easily deployable to a service such as Replit, so that we can easily spin up an instance to check out your application.
- PDF or Markdown document with your Integration Strategy write-up. 
- **Optional** Screenshots or access details for your bonus dashboard/logging solution.

## Further Notes

-	You are encouraged to use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Claude, Gemini) to help accelerate your delivery. Ensure you understand the generated code and document your reasoning clearly. Your grasp and thoughtful integration of AI-generated content will be evaluated.
-	This assessment is meant to be time-scoped, in respect of your busy schedules. As a guideline the tasks above should take no more than 10 hours of focused time.
