# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Implement a basic RAG pipeline to ground your agent's responses. You may use:

- A small document collection
- Mocked/Generated telco knowledge base 
- Public web available data

Clearly indicate in your response logs when retrieved information is being utilized. Whilst there is limited opportunity to extensively fine-tune, do state some your proposed techniques/approaches to improve the RAG pipeline
