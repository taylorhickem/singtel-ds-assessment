# Custom Agent and Tool
Implement a new custom agent and at least one custom tool suitable for a telecommunications use case. Possible examples include:

- Telco Products/Roaming plan recommendation engine (preferred, due to immediate relevance to JD)
- Billing dispute parsing and categorization (good to have)
- Data usage history check (good to have)

Mocked data is allowed to enable the toolâ€™s demonstration. To keep within a time bound, please describe some of the approaches you have planned and would have utilised, if given sufficient time.

Clearly document:

- The specific business problem your custom tool addresses.
- Integration method between your tool and the agent.
