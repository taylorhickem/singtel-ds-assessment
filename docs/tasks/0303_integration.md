# Integration Strategy and Approach (Write-up)
Provide a concise (~400 words) strategy document outlining:

- Possible deployment methods for your agent in an enterprise telco environment (e.g., WhatsApp, Microsoft Teams, web portal).
- Anticipated practical integration challenges (authentication, latency, UI design, scalability).
- Metrics to evaluate agent performance and value in a production environment.

## Strategy

The agent will be packaged as a lightweight Python service exposing a REST API
via **FastAPI**. This keeps deployment flexible – the same container image can
run in a VM, Kubernetes cluster or serverless platform. For immediate
demonstration the service can also be invoked from a simple command-line client
or Jupyter notebook.

### Deployment options

1. **Web portal** – integrate the API with an internal web application that
   provides login via the corporate SSO provider. This allows rapid iteration and
   easy access for employees.
2. **Microsoft Teams or Slack** – expose a chatbot interface using the
   respective platform SDKs. This lowers friction for frontline staff who already
   rely on these tools.
3. **WhatsApp Business** – for customer-facing interactions, integrate with a
   WhatsApp bot or similar messaging channel. The same API can power both
   internal and external interfaces.

### Key integration challenges

- **Authentication and secrets** – API keys for the LLM provider must be stored
  securely. Use environment variables loaded via `python-dotenv` and keep them
  out of version control. When deploying to cloud services, rely on secret
  managers or encrypted storage.
- **Latency and cost** – LLM calls introduce network latency. Caching frequent
  responses or using smaller models for quick classification tasks can improve
  performance. Monitoring token usage is essential for budgeting.
- **User experience** – responses should be concise and reference retrieved
  knowledge when applicable. Iterative testing with users will help tune prompts
  and conversation flow.
- **Scalability** – container-based deployment allows horizontal scaling. If the
  service becomes popular, a managed queue (e.g., RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus)
  can buffer incoming requests.

### Metrics

- **Turn‑around time** – average latency between user question and final answer.
- **Tool invocation counts** – frequency of the roaming recommendation tool and
  retrieval calls to gauge usefulness.
- **User satisfaction** – collect optional ratings or NPS scores after
  interactions.
- **Retrieval hit rate** – percentage of queries where relevant documents were
  found in the RAG index.

The overall goal is to keep the service modular so additional telco tools or new
retrieval sources can be plugged in with minimal changes. A small amount of
observability (request logging and token usage stats) will provide insights for
future optimisation.
